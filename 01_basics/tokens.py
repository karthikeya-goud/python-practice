# alphabets -> words  -> sentences -> paragraph
#charset    -> tokens -> lines     -> program

# so every language has thius above things
# in python
#   we use CharSets , we have ASCII and UNICODE support

# so in genral tokens are
# identifer
# keywords
# literals
# operators
# comments
# datatypes

a = 10

# 'a' is identifer
# = is operator
# 10 is interger literal


# Python supports only single line comment (#)
# Python is dynammic typed language so we dont mentioned datatypes 
# but from recent versions we can give type hinting to identifiers
